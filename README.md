<p>I'm a full-stack developer who builds end-to-end software applications for various companies (including e-commerce stores, software companies & consultants).</p>
<p>I usually work with a small team of 4 people (including my brother and two other developers) who fill in my technical gaps.</p>

<h2>Technical Stack</h2>

  <li>Python - Django, Flask, Beautiful Soup</li>

</ul>

  <li><a href='https://arhantayoga.org'>arhantayoga.org</a> - our team developed the AI chatbot on their site.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal Projects</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href='https://vujis.com' target="_blank">vujis.com</a> - this is a an app I built using PostgreSQL, Express.js, React & Node.js. If a company is looking to buy a specific commodity (e.g. rice, sugar), they can post a job on the platform and find a supplier. It is not live because we didn't want to pursue the idea and it was expensive to host. However, I have it available in development.</li>
  <li><a href='https://trupul.com' target="_blank">trupul.com</a> - this is an app I built to help me learn Mandarin. It leverages OpenAI's GPT API to randomly generate complex Mandarin sentences.</li>
