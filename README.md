<h1>I build end-to-end software applications & implement AI ðŸ¦¾ðŸ¦¿</h1>

<p>
  Hi! I'm a full-stack developer who builds end-to-end software applications for various companies (including e-commerce stores, software companies & consultants).
  <br/>
  I usually work with a small team of 4 people (including my brother and two other developers) who fill in my technical gaps.
