<h1>I build end-to-end software & implement AI ðŸ¦¾ðŸ¦¿</h1>

<p>I'm a full-stack developer who builds end-to-end software applications for various companies (including e-commerce stores, software companies & consultants).</p>
<p>I usually work with a small team of 4 people (including my brother and two other developers) who fill in my technical gaps.</p>

<h2>Technical Stack</h2>

<h2>Personal Projects</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href='https://vujis.com' target="_blank">vujis.com</a> - this is a an app I built using PostgreSQL, Express.js, React & Node.js. If a company is looking to buy a specific commodity (e.g. rice, sugar), they can post a job on the platform and find a supplier. It is not live because we didn't want to pursue the idea and it was expensive to host. However, I have it available in development.</li>
  <li><a href='https://triolingo-co-uk-3c93ad00e464.herokuapp.com/'>Triolingo</a> - this is an app I built to help me learn Mandarin. It leverages OpenAI's GPT API to randomly generate complex Mandarin sentences.</li>
  <li>I'll show you more on a call!</li>
</ul>
